# community-network-detection

Zachary's Karate Club is a well-known social network that represents the relationships between members of a university karate club.
A conflict arose between the administrator and the instructor of the club, leading to a split into two groups. The goal of this project
is to use community detection algorithms to predict this division based on the network structure and compare the predictions with
the actual division of the club members after the split.

Bear in mind that the prediction will be based solely on the network structure and won't take into consideration the environmental
factors of the real people of the club.
